    #
    # A subclass of EM::Connection that reads from the Varnish log SHM and
    # pushes single log entries on the channel passed to its constructor.
    #
    # Note that simply using an EM::Channel pretty much guarantees awful
    # performance, suitable only for extremely low workloads in a development
    # environment. The provided EM::BufferedChannel improves things quite a
    # bit: it has proved able to push about 150k entries per second
    # (corresponding to about 4k HTTP req/s), using a full CPU on a modern
    # MBP.
